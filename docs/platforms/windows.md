        C:\Users\rdio> mkdir rdio-scanner

        C:\Users\rdio> cd rdio-scanner

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner> tar -xvf ^

# Advanced customizations

## Listening on an alternate port

Here we want our [Rdio Scanner](https://guthub.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) instance to listen for connections on the standard HTTP port.

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner>rdio-scanner -listen :80
        
        Rdio Scanner v6.4.0
        ----------------------------------
        2022/05/27 10:53:31 server started
        2022/05/27 10:53:31 main interface at http://pc-windows
        2022/05/27 10:53:31 admin interface at http://pc-windows/admin

## Listening on a SSL port

It is recommended to share your [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) instance over the internet by listening to an SSL port.

You can use your own SSL certificates that match your domain name with `-ssl_cert_file` and `-ssl_key_file`. If your certificate comes with an intermediate CA certificate, simply add its contents to the standard certificate file.

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner>rdio-scanner ^
            -listen :80                         ^
            -ssl_cert_file mycert.crt           ^
            -ssl_key_file meykey.key            ^
            -ssl_listen :443
        
        Rdio Scanner v6.4.0
        ----------------------------------
        2022/05/27 11:05:43 server started
        2022/05/27 11:05:43 main interface at http://pc-windows
        2022/05/27 11:05:43 main interface at https://pc-windows
        2022/05/27 11:05:43 admin interface at https://pc-windows/admin

If you don't want to worry about SSL certificates, you can use the built-in Let's Encrypt auto-cert feature. This requires that you have both port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) open to the world. Also, your domain name should point to your IP address where [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner/) is running. The advantage of this approach is that everything is done automatically, no certificate request, no certificate renewal.

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner>rdio-scanner ^
            -listen :80                         ^
            -ssl_auto_cert mydomain.com         ^
            -ssl_listen :443

## Save your advanced configuration to a config file

You don't want to have to type everytime a long list of arguments. No problem, you can save your advanced configuration to a file by adding the **-config_save** argument.

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner>rdio-scanner ^
            -listen :80                         ^
            -ssl_auto_cert mydomain.com         ^
            -ssl_listen :443                    ^
            -config_save
        2022/05/27 11:08:28 rdio-scanner.ini file created

All of your parameters passed as arguments to [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) have been saved to an INI file which has the same arguments/values list.

        db_file = rdio-scanner.db
        db_type = sqlite
        listen = :80
        ssl_auto_cert = mydomain.com
        ssl_listen = :443

Then simply run [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) without any arguments.

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner>rdio-scanner
        
        Rdio Scanner v6.4.0
        ----------------------------------
        2022/05/27 11:11:28 server started
        2022/05/27 11:11:28 main interface at http://pc-windows
        2022/05/27 11:11:28 main interface at https://pc-windows
        2022/05/27 11:11:28 admin interface at https://pc-windows/admin

        C:\Users\rdio\rdio-scanner>rdio-scanner -service install
