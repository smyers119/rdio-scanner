![control Area](./images/webapp-controls.png?raw=true)\

| Button                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| ![LIVE FEED](./images/webapp-control-livefeed-partial.png?raw=true) | When active, incoming audio will be played according to the active systems/talkgroups on the **SELECT TG** panel. The LED can also be _yellow_ if playing audio from the archive while **LIVE FEED** is inactive, this is called **playback mode**. Disabling **LIVE FEED** will also stop any playing audio and will clear the listening queue.         |

| ![SELECT TG](./images/webapp-control-select.png?raw=true)           | Display the systems/talkgroups selection panel where you decide which audio you want to listen to in _LIVE FEED_ mode, not in playback mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Select panel

![select panel](./images/webapp-select.png?raw=true)\

Here you select which systems/talkgroups/groups you want to listen to while in _LIVE FEED_ mode.  Note that the selection panel has no effect if you play calls from the search panel.

### Groups section

![groups section](./images/webapp-select-groups.png?raw=true)\

The first section concerns group selection. This section can be disabled from the configuration file, but is active by default. Each button has three states:

| Button                                                        | State                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![ON](./images/webapp-select-group-on.png?raw=true)           | All talkgroups, from any systems, that correspond to this group are actives. If you press it while it is active, it will make these talkgroups inactives.                          |
| ![OFF](./images/webapp-select-group-off.png?raw=true)         | All talkgroups, from any systems, that correspond to this group are inactives. If you press it while it is inactive, it will make these talkgroups actives.                        |
| ![PARTIAL](./images/webapp-select-group-partial.png?raw=true) | Some talkgroups, from any systems, that correspond to this group are actives and some are inactives. If you press it while it is active, it will make all these talkgroups active. |
| ![ALL OFF](./images/webapp-select-all-off.png?raw=true)       | Make every groups inactives, thereby disabling all talkgroups.                                                                                                                     |
| ![ALL ON](./images/webapp-select-all-on.png?raw=true)         | Make every groups active, thereby enabling all talkgroups.                                                                                                                         |

### Systems section

![systems section](./images/webapp-select-system.png?raw=true)\

This is much like the group section, but for each system. There is also just two states for each button:

| Button                                                  | State                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![ON](./images/webapp-select-system-on.png?raw=true)    | The talkgroup from this system is active. If you press it while it is active, it will make the talkgroup inactive.   |
| ![OFF](./images/webapp-select-system-off.png?raw=true)  | The talkgroup from this system is inactive. If you press it while it is inactive, it will make the talkgroup active. |
| ![ALL OFF](./images/webapp-select-all-off.png?raw=true) | Make inactive every talkgroups from this system.                                                                     |
| ![ALL ON](./images/webapp-select-all-on.png?raw=true)   | Make active every talkgroups from this system.                                                                       |

## Search panel

![search panel](./images/webapp-search.png?raw=true)\

### List section

![search list](./images/webapp-search-list.png?raw=true)\

This section presents the list of archived audio files stored in the database. Depending on the _LIVE FEED_ mode you are at, the replay function behaves differently:

| Mode                                                                        | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![LIVE FEED ON](./images/webapp-control-livefeed-on.png?raw=true)           | while **LIVE FEED** is active, press the **PLAY** button to play this audio file. If another audio file is playing, it will be stopped and the one you just selected will be played instead. After playback finishes, the listening queue will resume as normal.                                                           |
| ![LIVE FEED PARTIAL](./images/webapp-control-livefeed-partial.png?raw=true) | This is the **playback mode** which can be activated only if **LIVE FEED** is inactive. Press the **PLAY** button to play this audio file. After playback is finishes, the next audio file from in list is played. While the audio is playing, pressing the **STOP** button will cancel the playback mode.                 |

\pagebreak{}
At the bottom left of this section is the toggle switch which allows you to toggle between play buttons and download buttons. The later ones allows you to download locally the audio file.

At the bottom right of this section is the _paginator_ to browse the whole database. This _paginator_ is disabled while in playback mode.

> Note that playback mode always requires your web app to be online. It is called like that because it plays archived audio files from the database.

### Filters section

![filters section](./images/webapp-search-filters.png?raw=true)\

This is the section where you filter the archived audio to a specific date, system, talkgroup, groups and tags. You can also change the sort order.

There is also a small slider that changes the **PLAY** buttons to **DOWNLOAD** buttons. This allows you to download audio files individually regardless of the playback mode you use.

> Note that if you change any filter while in playback mode, it will deactivate it.
